-> How it works

-first create a database in the firebase than write data in this there is questions,answer and options
 give every doc a title that must be A Date in dd-MM-yy format.
-every time you enter the data than they are shown in app.
-user can go to quiz screen by clicking mainActivity cards or direct through date picker.
-after completing quiz use goes to result activity than back to mainActivity.

so yeah that's it FOR NOW
